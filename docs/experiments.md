## Experiment Guidelines

### Data Collection Standards
1. **Prompt Quality**
   - Clear, specific questions in target domain
   - Varied difficulty levels (beginner to expert)
   - Real-world relevance and practical applicability

2. **Response Quality (SFT)**
   - Technically accurate and up-to-date
   - Well-structured with examples when appropriate
   - Appropriate length (100-800 tokens)
   - Professional tone and style

3. **Preference Pairs (DPO)**
   - Chosen responses: High quality as per SFT standards
   - Rejected responses: Common issues (inaccurate, incomplete, generic)
   - Clear quality difference but same prompt

### Evaluation Methodology
1. **Automatic Metrics**
   - lm-eval-harness scores (HellaSwag, TruthfulQA, etc.)
